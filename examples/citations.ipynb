The five main reporting domains are: the country as a whole, all urban areas, the capital Asmara, other urban areas outside Asmara, and rural areas. Estimates of selected variables were also produced for each of the six administrative zones j in the country.\\n\\nSince there has been no national census, the sampling frame used for the survey was constructed from a combination of data sources. In rural areas, the sampling frame consisted of a list of villages with population figures collected by the Ministry of Local Government and the sampling units were villages. In urban areas, data on zobas (administrative units) and mimihidars (smaller units within zobas) collected by the NSO between August 1994 and January 1995 were used in the selection of mimihidars as sampling units. In the capital, Asmara, the sampling units were also mimihidars; however, since reliable data on population size did not exist for these mimihidars, the measure of size used for sample selection was the number of registered voters. From this, the number of households and the population size were estimated. A mapping and household listing operation was implemented to update the population size of the sampling units prior to selecting the households for the survey.\\n\\nThe sample for the EDHS was selected in two stages. First, 108 villages and 100 mimihidars were selected with probability proportional to size. When villages and mimihidars were very large (in population size), they were segmented and only one segment was selected for the survey, so that each cluster (sample point) corresponded generally to a village, a mimihidar, or part of a village or mimihidar. A complete listing of the households residing in the selected clusters was carried out. The list of households obtained was used as the frame for second-stage sampling, the selection of households to be visited by the EDHS survey teams during the main fieldwork. Women in these households between the ages of 15 and 49 were identified and interviewed. In one-third of the households selected for the survey, men between the ages of 15 and 59 were also interviewed.\\n\\nOn average, 25 households were selected in each urban cluster and 35 in each rural cluster. It was expected that the sample would yield interviews with approximately 5,000 women age 15 to 49 and 1,400 men age 15 to 59. Because of the non-proportional distribution of the sample in the 10 provinces that existed at the time of the sample design, sampling weights were applied to the data in this report.\\n\\nNote: See detailed description of sample design in APPENDIX A of the survey report.', 'coll_mode': 'Face-to-face [f2f]', 'research_instrument': \"Four types of questionnaires were used in the Eritrea Demographic and Health Survey: the Household Questionnaire, the Women's Questionnaire, the Men's Questionnaire, and the Service Availability Questionnaire. The Service Availability Questionnaire was based on the model questionnaire used in many recent DHS surveys, while the other questionnaires were based on the DHS Model B Questionnaire for Low Contraceptive Prevalence Countries. After a meeting with potential data users all the questionnaires were modified slightly to adapt them to the situation in Eritrea. The Household Questionnaire was used to list the names and background characteristics of all usual members and visitors to a selected household. The Women's Questionnaire was used to collect information from women age 15-49. In addition, interviewing teams measured the height and weight of mothers and their children under age three. The EDHS survey also included three modules in the women's and the men's questionnaire, namely, maternal mortality, awareness of AIDS, and female circumcision. Information from a sub-sample of men age 15-59 was collected using a Men's Questionnaire. The Service Availability Questionnaire was used to collect information on the health, family planning services and other social services in the sampled clusters. All the questionnaires were first translated from English into Tigrigna. In addition, the Women's and Men's Questionnaires were also translated into Tigre, Kunama, and Afar.\", 'coll_situation': 'Pretest training and field testing took place in April 1995. For the first three weeks, 7 female and 2 male interviewers were trained to carry out the pretest. Following the training, the pretest fieldwork was conducted over a three-week period during which approximately 250 interviews were completed. Debriefing sessions were held with the pretest field staff and necessary modifications to questionnaires were made based on the experience of the pretest exercise.\\n\\nTraining of the field staff for the main survey was conducted during a one-month period in August, 1995. The training course consisted of instructions regarding interviewing techniques and field procedures, a detailed review of items on the questionnaire, instruction and practice in weighing and measuring children and women and mock interviews with men and women of eligible age in areas outside the EDHS sample points. Within the constraint of ensuring that there was an adequate number of interviewers for each of the four local languages, interviewers were selected on the basis of overall performance in class, scores on the tests given in class, and performance during field practice interviews. From among those selected candidates suitable as field editors and supervisors were identified. The supervisors, field editors, and male interviewers/team leaders were given additional training in coordination of fieldwork, methods of field editing, and data quality control procedures.\\n\\nThe EDHS fieldwork was carried out by eight teams, each consisting of one male interviewer/team leader, one female supervisor, one female field editor, four female interviewers, and driver. Five field survey coordinators, three permanent professional staff from the National Statistics Office, and two persons selected from among the trainees were assigned to oversee the teams, facilitate fieldwork activities, and monitor data quality. Data collection took place over a four-month period from mid-September 1995 to mid-January 1996. However, most data collection was completed by end of 1995.', 'cleaning_operations': 'All questionnaires for the EDHS were returned to the NSO for data processing, which consisted of office editing, coding of open-ended questions, data entry, and secondary editing (editing computer identified errors). The data were processed by a team consisting of four entry clerks and a data entry supervisor. The head of the data processing unit at the NSO provided overall supervision. Data entry and editing were accomplished using the computer program ISSA (Integrated System for Survey Analysis). Data processing commenced on 11 September 1995 and was completed on 9 March 1996.'}, 'analysis_info': {'response_rate': 'A total of 6,258 households were selected in the sample, of which 5,642 were occupied at the time of the survey (\"found\"). The shortfall was largely because some households no longer existed in the sampled clusters at the time of interview. Of the 5,642 households that existed at the time of the survey, 5,469 were interviewed, yielding a household response rate of 97 percent.\\n\\nIn the interviewed households 5,250 eligible women were identified of whom 5,054 were interviewed, yielding a response rate of 96 percent. In one-third of the households 1,267 eligible men were identified of which 1,114 were successfully interviewed (88 percent response). The lower response rate for men was due to frequent and longer absences of men for seasonal work.\\n\\nUrban response rates were higher than rural response rates, the difference being especially pronounced for the men\\'s survey. In urban areas, 91 percent of eligible men were interviewed, compared with 85 percent of men in rural areas.\\n\\nNote: See summarized response rates by place of residence in Table 1.1 of the survey report.', 'sampling_error_estimates': 'The estimates from a sample survey are affected by two types of errors: (1) non-sampling errors, and (2) sampling errors. Non-sampling errors are the results of mistakes made in implementing data collection and data processing, such as failure to locate and interview the correct household, misunderstanding of the questions on the part of either the interviewer or the respondent, and data entry errors. Although numerous efforts were made during the implementation of the EDHS to minimize this type of error, non-sampling errors are impossible to avoid and difficult to evaluate statistically.\\n\\nSampling errors, on the other hand, can be evaluated statistically. The sample of respondents selected in the EDHS is only one of many samples that could have been selected from the same population, using the same design and expected size. Each of these samples would yield results that differ somewhat from the results of the actual sample selected. Sampling errors are a measure of the variability between all possible samples. Although the degree of variability is not known exactly, it can be estimated from the survey results.\\n\\nA sampling error is usually measured in terms of the standard error for a particular statistic (mean, percentage, etc.), which is the square root of the variance. The standard error can be used to calculate confidence intervals within which the true value for the population can reasonably be assumed to fall. For example, for any given statistic calculated from a sample survey, the value of that statistic will fall within a range of plus or minus two times the standard error of that statistic in 95 percent of all possible samples of identical size and design.\\n\\nIf the sample of respondents had been selected as a simple random sample, it would have been possible to use straightforward formulas for calculating sampling errors. However, the EDHS sample is the result of a multi-stage stratified design, and, consequently, it was necessary to use more complex formulae. The computer software used to calculate sampling errors for the EDHS is the ISSA Sampling Error Module. This module used the Taylor linearization method of variance estimation for survey estimates that are means or proportions. The Jackknife repeated replication method is used for variance estimation of more complex statistics such as fertility and mortality rates.\\n\\nNote: See detailed estimate of sampling error calculation in APPENDIX B of the survey report.', 'data_appraisal': 'Data Quality Tables\\n- Household age distribution\\n- Age distribution of eligible and interviewed women\\n- Completeness of reporting\\n- Births by calendar years\\n- Reporting of age at death in days\\n- Reporting of age at death in months\\n\\nNote: See detailed tables in APPENDIX C of the report which is presented in this documentation.'}}, 'data_access': {'dataset_use': {'contact': [{'name': 'MEASURE DHS', 'affiliation': '', 'email': 'archive@measuredhs.com', 'uri': 'www.measuredhs.com'}], 'cit_req': 'Use of the dataset must be acknowledged using a citation which would include:\\n- the Identification of the Primary Investigator\\n- the title of the survey (including country, acronym and year of implementation)\\n- the survey reference number\\n- the source and date of download', 'disclaimer': 'The user of the data acknowledges that the original collector of the data, the authorized distributor of the data, and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.'}}}}}}\n"

While the total Asian population increased from 1.4 billion in 1950 to 4.7 billion by 2020, the percentage of Muslims in Asia increased from 23% in 1950 to 31% by 2020, which amounts to more than one percentage point per decade.', 'keywords': None, 'notes': None, 'doi': None, 'flag': None, 'owner': 'reagan', 'country': None, 'url_status': None, 'created_by': '1', 'changed_by': '1', 'attachment': None, 'lang': None}, {'id': '38', 'uuid': 'ihsn-2611', 'title': 'Measuring adult mortality using sibling survival: a new analytical method and new results for 44 countries, 1974-2006', 'subtitle': 'PLoS Medicine', 'alt_title': None, 'authors': [{'id': '316', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Ziad ', 'lname': 'Obermeyer', 'initial': '', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '317', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Julie ', 'lname': 'Rajaratnam', 'initial': 'K', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '318', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Chang ', 'lname': 'Park', 'initial': 'H', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '319', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Emmanuela ', 'lname': 'Gakidou', 'initial': '', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '320', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Margaret ', 'lname': 'Hogan', 'initial': 'C', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '321', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Alan ', 'lname': 'Lopez', 'initial': 'D', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '322', 'cid': '38', 'fname': 'Christopher ', 'lname': 'Murray', 'initial': 'J', 'author_type': 'author'}], 'editors': None, 'translators': None, 'changed': '1607045534', 'created': '1607045534', 'published': '1', 'volume': '7', 'issue': '4', 'idnumber': None, 'edition': None, 'place_publication': None, 'place_state': None, 'publisher': None, 'publication_medium': '0', 'url': 'http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000260&representation=PDF', 'page_from': 'e1000', 'page_to': None, 'data_accessed': None, 'organization': None, 'ctype': 'journal', 'pub_day': None, 'pub_month': None, 'pub_year': '2010', 'abstract': 'Background\\nFor several decades, global public health efforts have focused on the development and application of disease control programs to improve child survival in developing populations. The need to reliably monitor the impact of such intervention programs in countries has led to significant advances in demographic methods and data sources, particularly with large-scale, cross-national survey programs such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Although no comparable effort has been undertaken for adult mortality, the availability of large datasets with information on adult survival from censuses and household surveys offers an important opportunity to dramatically improve our knowledge about levels and trends in adult mortality in countries without good vital registration. To date, attempts to measure adult mortality from questions in censuses and surveys have generally led to implausibly low levels of adult mortality owing to biases inherent in survey data such as survival and recall bias. Recent methodological developments and the increasing availability of large surveys with information on sibling survival suggest that it may well be timely to reassess the pessimism that has prevailed around the use of sibling histories to measure adult mortality.\\n\\nMethods and Findings\\nWe present the Corrected Sibling Survival (CSS) method, which addresses both the survival and recall biases that have plagued the use of survey data to estimate adult mortality. Using logistic regression, our method directly estimates the probability of dying in a given country, by age, sex, and time period from sibling history data. The logistic regression framework borrows strength across surveys and time periods for the estimation of the age patterns of mortality, and facilitates the implementation of solutions for the underrepresentation of high-mortality families and recall bias. We apply the method to generate estimates of and trends in adult mortality, using the summary measure 45q15â€”the probability of a 15-y old dying before his or her 60th birthdayâ€”for 44 countries with DHS sibling survival data. Our findings suggest that levels of adult mortality prevailing in many developing countries are substantially higher than previously suggested by other analyses of sibling history data. Generally, our estimates show the risk of adult death between ages 15 and 60 y to be about 20%â€“35% for females and 25%â€“45% for males in sub-Saharan African populations largely unaffected by HIV. In countries of Southern Africa, where the HIV epidemic has been most pronounced, as many as eight out of ten men alive at age 15 y will be dead by age 60, as will six out of ten women. Adult mortality levels in populations of Asia and Latin America are generally lower than in Africa, particularly for women. The exceptions are Haiti and Cambodia, where mortality risks are comparable to many countries in Africa. In all other countries with data, the probability of dying between ages 15 and 60 y was typically around 10% for women and 20% for men, not much higher than the levels prevailing in several more developed countries.\\n\\nConclusions\\nOur results represent an expansion of direct knowledge of levels and trends in adult mortality in the developing world. The CSS method provides grounds for renewed optimism in collecting sibling survival data. We suggest that all nationally representative survey programs with adequate sample size ought to implement this critical module for tracking adult mortality in order to more reliably understand the levels and patterns of adult mortality, and how they are changing.', 'keywords': None, 'notes': None, 'doi': None, 'flag': None, 'owner': 'matt', 'country': None, 'url_status': None, 'created_by': '1', 'changed_by': '1', 'attachment': None, 'lang': None}, {'id': '69', 'uuid': 'ihsn-5626', 'title': 'Water, sanitation and child health - Evidence from the Demographic and Health Surveys 1986-2007', 'subtitle': None, 'alt_title': None, 'authors': [{'id': '208', 'cid': '69', 'fname': 'Gunther', 'lname': 'Fink', 'initial': '', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '209', 'cid': '69', 'fname': 'Isabel', 'lname': 'Gunther', 'initial': '', 'author_type': 'author'}, {'id': '210', 'cid': '69', 'fname': 'Kenneth', 'lname': 'Hill', 'initial': '', 'author_type': 'author'}], 'editors': None, 'translators': None, 'changed': '1607045525', 'created': '1607045525', 'published': '1', 'volume': None, 'issue': None, 'idnumber': None, 'edition': None, 'place_publication': None, 'place_state': None, 'publisher': None, 'publication_medium': '0', 'url': 'http://www.harvardschoolofpublichealth.net/faculty/gunther-fink/files/water_and_sanitation_and_child_health_march2010.pdf', 'page_from': None, 'page_to': None, 'data_accessed': None, 'organization': None, 'ctype': 'report', 'pub_day': None, 'pub_month': 'March', 'pub_year': '2010', 'abstract': None, 'keywords': None, 'notes': None, 'doi': None, 'flag': None, 'owner': 'matt', 'country': None, 'url_status': None, 'created_by': '1', 'changed_by': '1', 'attachment': None, 'lang': 'English'}, {'id': '31', 'uuid': 'ihsn-8458', 'title': 'Nutritional status and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa, 1950-1980', 'subtitle': 'Economics & Human Biology', 'alt_title': None, 'authors': [{'id': '302', 'cid': '31', 'fname': 'Alexander', 'lname': 'Moradi', 'initial': '', 'author_type': 'author'}], 'editors': None, 'translators': None, 'changed': '1607045532', 'created': '1607045532', 'published': '1', 'volume': '8', 'issue': '1', 'idnumber': None, 'edition': None, 'place_publication': None, 'place_state': None, 'publisher': None, 'publication_medium': '0', 'url': 'http://economics.ouls.ox.ac.uk/14037/1/gprg-wps-046.pdf', 'page_from': '16', 'page_to': '29', 'data_accessed': None, 'organization': None, 'ctype': 'journal', 'pub_day': None, 'pub_month': None, 'pub_year': '2010', 'abstract': 'Nutrition and health are important dimensions of human well-being. Both aspects are complementary to income and deserve attention in its own right. However, there is an interrelationship between economic development and nutritional status which this study aims to investigate. We use a populationâ€™s mean height as an indicator of nutritional intake net of claims due to diseases. Based on more than 200,000 women from 28 sub-Saharan African countries, we find that nutritional status was in a good state in the 1960s. However, stagnating and decreasing mean heights indicate a poor development. In fact, the entire Southwest and Southeast of the African continent went to a nutritional crisis.\\n\\nIn a regression analysis, we model the entire span of bodily growth and find a significant and very robust influence of economic growth on final adult height at two distinct periods: during the first years of life and puberty. We also take into account the possible endogeneity of economic development due to increased productivity, but do not find evidence of endogeneity.

New innovations are necessary to develop reasonable estimates from available information. One readily available resource is household survey data. While birth histories collected in surveys have produced reasonable estimates of child mortality, the use of sibling survival data collected in similar household surveys has not been comprehensively analysed, largely because of concerns of underreporting.Methods This paper uses sibling survival schedules from 29 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to generate estimates of under-5 mortality and of the summary measure of adult mortality 45q15â€šÃ„Ã®the probability of dying between ages 15 and 59. These are then compared with UN child and adult mortality estimates.Results Sibling history data collected in these household surveys seems to contain adequate information to estimate adult mortality rates, though there are problems with underreporting. The correlation coefficient between UN estimates and DHS estimates is 0.74 for adult mortality, indicating a strong relationship between the two but suggesting there may be underreporting of adult deaths in the survey data.Conclusions Further investigation is necessary to determine the usefulness of household survey data for the estimation of adult mortality. New survey instruments like the World Health Survey have incorporated questions to help correct for underreporting in sibling histories. Further analyses need to be carried out in countries where vital registration data are also available, to determine how well household survey data do in estimating adult mortality and whether improvements in the survey instrument adequately correct for underreporting of deaths.', 'keywords': None, 'notes': None, 'doi': None, 'flag': None, 'owner': 'reagan', 'country': None, 'url_status': None, 'created_by': '1', 'changed_by': '1', 'attachment': None, 'lang': 'English'}]}\n"
